# LandingPage | theOdinProject

## A nonfunctional landing page written in HTML and CSS

This project is an example landing page built along the foundational knoweldge course from theOdinProject utilizing HTML and CSS. It is currently nonfunctional and serves as a step for my full-stack learning curriculum. Further functionality will be added as I continue to learn more about web development and javascript. Every part of this project showcases the foundations of creating a website from scratch with the following tools:

* HTML boilertplate
* FlexBox
* CSS

## See the landing page in action!
